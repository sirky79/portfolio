         <h5> Exercise 3 </h5>
		<p>
		This exercise brought alot of challenges when it comes to syncing both child and parent functions.
    However, once I had it figured out I was able to have it run smoothly, I think that this exercise definetly supported my code in terms of learning how to use rotation and translation tools, along with push, pop. I'm glad I was able to learn about some of the most difficult parts of using P5 <br>

		<p>
      For my second exercise I experimented with preloading images and fonts, then using mousepressed and keypressed commands to control my images. I had quite some trouble getting everything figured out at first because it was alot more complex when it comes to having everything at the right spot. Additionally, using && statements along with mouse pressed to fully get my code to function properly for my frog to come out. <br>

		<p>
		I wanted to make something simple yet unique so I took an approach to add different patterns of colors in one of my main brushes to kind of be the outline of all my images. I had 6 brushes, 2 of which were simple lines I took form our class examples,and a eraser. At first I had some trouble getting all brushes to work due to mislabel of function but after I got it figured out I was able to create many versions of drawings.<br>    
        I want to add that the most difficult part is probably getting everything to function and work properly, especially when it came to checking for brush commands and wheather they are at the correct spot with the right names.
