<h1> Exercise 3 </h1>

<p>  In this sketch I started to work with custom functions and the tranlation functions along with rotations It was difficult when first looking at speedX/speedY movements but after figuring it out I was able to get it running smoothly. <br>
<p>
    I had alot of trouble trying to figure out how to get my parent and child functions in sync but besides that I think this project worked out pretty well for me. <br>    
    Its two simple penguins spinning around the screen, one with glasses and the other with a black hat.  <br>
