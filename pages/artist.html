                <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
                <p>Hi! My name is Shanglong Chen. I am a transfer student and a current DMA applicant. When it comes to creating art, it's something that has always been of interest, though my philosophy behind art has changed over time. As a child, I was always inspired to draw off different TV shows and cartoons with an old sketchbook, along with using art as a form of expression for my emotions. When I first discovered digital art, I was amazed by all the different varieties of tools that can be used to create compelling artwork. As a result, I started to work with many different mediums starting with Procreate where I began my first series of digital drawings. Then by the end of my high school years, I got into many Adobe softwares like Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, Premier Pro and Maya. This lead me to develop my skills onto many platforms and it was when I figured that I want to pursue a career into creating digital content. 
                    As of now, I’m mainly focused on Photoshop, where I used to connect with movies, music artists, and video games through a series of photo manipulations. This method of art creation has been an ideal work form for me because it opens up opportunities to tell stories and emotions through a singular photo. I take a lot of inspiration from album covers as they set a prior emotional state for the audience even before listening to the song itself. After studying in San Jose State for the first year, I have decided to expand on my skillset through Adobe Premier Pro, After Effects, and Illustrator. I took a lot of time and inspiration from my professors to learn how I can use these tools to contribute to my future career. This was a time that I truly cherished because it was extremely fun to learn and create my desired themes within the different mediums. For video art, I take inspiration from Youtube vlogs because, growing up as a kid, I’ve watched countless vlogs of things artists/YouTubers do for their routine and simply because they are fun to watch. Though I’ve never worked with Premier Pro in the past, I was able to adapt fairly quickly and create my own version of a morning routine vlog. In animation, I look mainly towards videogames, as I’m a big gamer myself as well I thought recreating a different variation of an ideal game would be fun. In everything I mentioned, digital art has opened so many opportunities for me to create a variety of artworks through the use of different tools and mediums. I am extremely proud of that, though I’m still not great at all the tools, I feel more confident when it comes to managing a good composition in my works and creating an aesthetic piece through different mediums. I’m extremely thrilled to expand my skills on various platforms because I believe that the more I know, the easier to express my artworks to the world. As digital art has endless tools to work with, I want to be comfortable enough to create professional pieces and continue learning down the road of my career.
